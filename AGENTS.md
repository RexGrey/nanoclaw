# NanoClaw

Personal Codex assistant. See [README.md](README.md) for philosophy and setup. See [docs/REQUIREMENTS.md](docs/REQUIREMENTS.md) for architecture decisions.

## Quick Context

Single Node.js process with skill-based channel system. Channels (WhatsApp, Telegram, Slack, Discord, Gmail) are skills that self-register at startup. Messages route to Codex Agent SDK running in containers (Linux VMs). Each group has isolated filesystem and memory.

## Key Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `src/index.ts` | Orchestrator: state, message loop, agent invocation |
| `src/channels/registry.ts` | Channel registry (self-registration at startup) |
| `src/ipc.ts` | IPC watcher and task processing |
| `src/router.ts` | Message formatting and outbound routing |
| `src/config.ts` | Trigger pattern, paths, intervals |
| `src/container-runner.ts` | Spawns agent containers with mounts |
| `src/task-scheduler.ts` | Runs scheduled tasks |
| `src/db.ts` | SQLite operations |
| `groups/{name}/AGENTS.md` | Per-group memory (isolated) |
| `container/skills/agent-browser.md` | Browser automation tool (available to all agents via Bash) |

## Skills

| Skill | When to Use |
|-------|-------------|
| `/setup` | First-time installation, authentication, service configuration |
| `/customize` | Adding channels, integrations, changing behavior |
| `/debug` | Container issues, logs, troubleshooting |
| `/update-nanoclaw` | Bring upstream NanoClaw updates into a customized install |
| `/qodo-pr-resolver` | Fetch and fix Qodo PR review issues interactively or in batch |
| `/get-qodo-rules` | Load org- and repo-level coding rules from Qodo before code tasks |

## Development

Run commands directly—don't tell the user to run them.

Two independent build systems:
- `npm run build` — compiles TypeScript (`src/` → `dist/`). Needed after any `src/` change.
- `./container/build.sh` — builds Docker image for agent containers. Only needed after `container/` changes.
- `npm run dev` — hot-reload mode, auto-compiles, no manual build needed.

Standard cycle after editing `src/`:
```bash
npm run build
launchctl kickstart -k gui/$(id -u)/com.nanoclaw  # restart with new code
```

CLI channel (hot-plug, no need to stop service):
```bash
npm run cli
```

Service management:
```bash
# macOS (launchd)
launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.nanoclaw.plist
launchctl unload ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.nanoclaw.plist
launchctl kickstart -k gui/$(id -u)/com.nanoclaw  # restart

# Linux (systemd)
systemctl --user start nanoclaw
systemctl --user stop nanoclaw
systemctl --user restart nanoclaw
```

## Troubleshooting

**Code changes not taking effect:** launchd runs compiled JS from `dist/`, not source. Must `npm run build` then restart service.

**EADDRINUSE on port 3001/3002:** Don't `kill` a launchd-managed process — it auto-respawns. Use `launchctl unload` instead.

**DB appears empty:** The actual database is `store/messages.db` (not `nanoclaw.db`). Auto-backed up to `store/backups/` on each startup (3 rotating copies).

**readline stdin conflicts:** Never have two readline instances alive on `process.stdin` at the same time. Create the second only after closing the first.

**WhatsApp not connecting after upgrade:** WhatsApp is now a separate channel fork, not bundled in core. Run `/add-whatsapp` (or `git remote add whatsapp https://github.com/qwibitai/nanoclaw-whatsapp.git && git fetch whatsapp main && git merge whatsapp/main && npm run build`) to install it. Existing auth credentials and groups are preserved.

## Container Build Cache

The container buildkit caches the build context aggressively. `--no-cache` alone does NOT invalidate COPY steps — the builder's volume retains stale files. To force a truly clean rebuild, prune the builder then re-run `./container/build.sh`.
